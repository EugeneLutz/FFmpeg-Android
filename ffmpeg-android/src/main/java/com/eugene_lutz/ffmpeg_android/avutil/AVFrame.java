/**
 * This structure describes decoded (raw) audio or video data.
 *
 * AVFrame must be allocated using av_frame_alloc(). Note that this only
 * allocates the AVFrame itself, the buffers for the data must be managed
 * through other means (see below).
 * AVFrame must be freed with av_frame_free().
 *
 * AVFrame is typically allocated once and then reused multiple times to hold
 * different data (e.g. a single AVFrame to hold frames received from a
 * decoder). In such a case, av_frame_unref() will free any references held by
 * the frame and reset it to its original clean state before it
 * is reused again.
 *
 * The data described by an AVFrame is usually reference counted through the
 * AVBuffer API. The underlying buffer references are stored in AVFrame.buf /
 * AVFrame.extended_buf. An AVFrame is considered to be reference counted if at
 * least one reference is set, i.e. if AVFrame.buf[0] != NULL. In such a case,
 * every single data plane must be contained in one of the buffers in
 * AVFrame.buf or AVFrame.extended_buf.
 * There may be a single buffer for all the data, or one separate buffer for
 * each plane, or anything in between.
 *
 * sizeof(AVFrame) is not a part of the public ABI, so new fields may be added
 * to the end with a minor bump.
 *
 * Fields can be accessed through AVOptions, the name string used, matches the
 * C structure field name for fields accessible through AVOptions. The AVClass
 * for AVFrame can be obtained from avcodec_get_frame_class()
